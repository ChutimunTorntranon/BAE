	"stamping": "In the production system for stamping work, the production line is 200 Ton to produce parts. In the group of works such as Engine Parts, Chassis Parts, Exhaust Parts, we have brought robots to help in the production system to increase the efficiency of production to be more accurate.",
	"spot": "Spot welding is a type of resistance welding that is commonly used to join metal plates that are laid. stacked with a thickness of up to 3 mm. Two electrodes conduct current to the workpiece and press the workpiece at the same time. The advantages of this process are low energy consumption And does not cause the workpiece to deform, works quickly, can be easily automated and no filling wire is required.",

	"Hstamp": "Stamping What is metal stamping?",
	"Tstamp1": "metal stamping",
	"Tstamp2": "It is one of the production processes for structural parts and components of electrical appliances, automobiles, airplanes, and parts of various industrial machines. It is a step that takes place after the extraction process. Powder casting and compaction which after passing the metal forming from the metal stamping factory It will go into the process of grinding, polishing, painting until the metal work is obtained. Then be assembled with various parts, etc. In general, metal stamping can be classified.",

	"Hstamp1": "Advantages from Stamping process ?",
	"Tstamp3": "in all processes mentioned above Stamping is the best process out of all. have superior advantages Whether casting (casting), forging (forging) and milling (machining), the advantages are divided into the following.",
	"Tstamp4": "Helps forming complex workpieces easier than other methods.",
	"Tstamp5": "After stamping, there is no need to decorate the work piece in any way.",
	"Tstamp6": "Workpieces that have been stamped will be the same in every piece, observed from the assembly of the workpiece.",
	"Tstamp7": "have more strength as well as other mechanical properties",
	"Tstamp8": "The work piece is very light.",
	"Tstamp9": "The rate can be achieved in high volumes.",

	"zinc1": "Advantages of galvanizing (zince)",
	"zinc2": "Zinc plating is an ideal tool for protecting iron and steel products from corrosion. The metallurgical bond between zinc and steel allows zinc to corrode better and thereby protect iron or steel from rusting. The basic principle behind electroplating is the process of coating a metal layer on a metal base using direct current through an electrolyte solution. Zinc is one of the most easily coated metals. It provides good corrosion protection without the use of exotic chemicals. The surface can be polished to give a",
	"zinc3": "shine",
	"zince": "almost",
	"zinc4": "as much as chromium",
	"zinc5": "In addition, zinc plating produces a smoother, brighter surface in a shorter time than hot-dip galvanizing, where steel parts are processed in a bath of molten zinc. The alkaline zinc option offers consistent and reliable coverage compared to acid zinc with good brightness.",
	"zinc6": "Zinc plating is widely used in automotive and military applications. Mostly used with steel. But it works with aluminum, copper or brass with a special pre-coated finish. Colors are usually presented as clear (white), iridescent, green or black, depending on the type of plating after plating.",

	"edp1": "What is an EDP? How is it better than normal floor paint?",
	"edp2": "EDP stands for Electro Deposition Painting",
	"edp3": "This is an electroplating technology that utilizes electrical mechanisms to create a smooth, durable coating on metal surfaces. It produces a uniform thickness and shade of coating that is highly resistant to corrosion and has excellent adhesion properties. This makes it ideal for coating complex objects that cannot be painted using conventional methods.",
	"edp4": "Advantages of EDP plating ?",
	"edp5": "Able to plate smooth metal surface with uniform thickness. All parts of the groove can be coated. or normal deep nooks The spray can't be sprayed thoroughly.",
	"edp6": "It can effectively prevent rust.",
	"edp7": "No impact on the environment",

	"ch1": "Chromium What is chrome plating?",
	"ch2": "chrome plating",
	"ch3": "is a metal plating technology that uses an electromechanical mechanism This way you get a smooth coating. Can withstand high corrosion Consistent coating thickness and shade Improve the adhesion force. Commonly used for coating complex materials such as car parts. Electronic parts, etc. Metal plating can be plated on a variety of materials, including steel, aluminum, zinc, etc.",
	"ch4": "Advantages of Chromium plating ?",
	"ch5": "Helps the plated material have a beautiful shine. Prevents abrasions from corrosion and impact.",
